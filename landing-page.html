        <h2> Daytona</h2>
        <p>Rolex first started experimenting with mechanical chronographs during the 1930s, but it was not until 1963, with the introduction of the Rolex 6239, that an actual name was given to their chronograph line of watches. Although many consider this reference to be the first Daytona, it was not until almost 1965 that the "Daytona" name actually made its debut appearance on the dial. In those two years before the addition of the Daytona name, Rolex’s chronograph line was known simply as the "Cosmograph" - a name that still remains on the Daytona dials that are manufactured today.

            An evolution of the ref. 6238, the redesigned ref. 6239 marked the first time in Rolex history that inverted colors were used for the chronograph registers - black on silver, or white on black, depending on the variation previous Rolex chronograph dials were entirely monochromatic). Additionally, the ref. 6239 also marked the first time that the tachymeter scale was engraved on the bezel, rather than printed on the surface of the dial - something that has since become one of the defining characteristic of Rolex's Daytona line of watches.
            
            When the "Daytona" name first appeared on the dial in 1964, it was printed under the word Cosmograph. However by 1967, the Daytona signature had migrated to the top of the 6 o'clock sub-dial, where it has remained ever since</p>

        <h2>Sky-dweller</h2>
        <p>The result was a watch with a brand new look and appeal, incredible new functionality, and a large presence, clocking in at 42mm. At the time, the world was also shocked by the Sky-Dweller’s uncharacteristically complex dial, despite the fact that the dual time zone was as intuitive as it was easy to use.

            Over its short history, the Sky-Dweller has seen some adjustments and upgrades. However, Rolex is still very much writing history with this one, as we’re still only in the first generation. To best explore how the Sky-Dweller has evolved over its first decade, we’ll look at the three upgrades presented since its debut in 2012.</p>

        <h2>Day Date</h2>
        <p>It was just a few years before Rolex founder Hans Wilsdorf passed away (1960) when Rolex introduced their wristwatch that could simultaneously display the day and date on the dial. The first Rolex Day-Date was introduced in 1956, with references 6510 (domed bezel) and 6511 (fluted bezel). This watch, the flagship of Rolex’s collection that was only available in 18-carat gold (white, yellow and rose) and platinum. These two references only lasted for one year, as the successor (6611) was already there in 1957 and had an updated version of the caliber 1055 movement (with free-sprung balance with micro-stella adjustment). This reference was in production till 1959. As you can see below, the hands looked slightly different from the later (and current) Rolex Day-Date models.</p>
